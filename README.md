# NewsAndObserver
This is a tool to take the CSV file with COVID-19 data from the News and Observer
newspaper and to make it accessible to LibreOffice.  I want to use months and days
with leading zeros.  Also, I will sort the file by County and Date and then
omit all by Henderson County.  The CSV file has headers in the first row, and
they can't be part of the sort.
